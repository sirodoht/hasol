Welcome, to our stunning, new, cleaning rota.

This week’s updated rota is the best rota we have ever published! The reasons are that we now have separate tasks for cleaning the vacuum cleaner, and cleaning the front porch. Those were introduced in past meetings as part of corridors and bins tasks (respectively), but they are now explicitly included to remind the Nurcroftians.

To the matter at hand—

Happy cleaning!
